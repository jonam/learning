Batch Processing and Stream Processing are two different methods of processing data.

**Batch Processing:**
In batch processing, data is collected over a period of time and then processed all at once. It is suitable for non-real-time processing tasks where data is processed in large chunks. For example, processing sales transactions at the end of the day or month.

**Stream Processing:**
In stream processing, data is processed as it arrives in real-time or near-real-time. It is suitable for scenarios where immediate processing of data is required, such as monitoring fraud transactions, real-time analytics, and processing live streams of data from sensors or social media feeds.

**Comparison:**
- *Latency*: Batch processing has high latency, while stream processing has low latency.
- *Complexity*: Stream processing is generally more complex than batch processing because it has to handle data in real-time.
- *Scalability*: Stream processing can be more scalable than batch processing because it can handle large volumes of data in real-time.
- *Data Freshness*: Stream processing provides fresher data than batch processing because it processes data as it arrives.
