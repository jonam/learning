**Design a Fault-Tolerant Stream Processing System:**

A fault-tolerant stream processing system can be designed with the following key components and strategies:

1. **Data Replication and Distribution:**
   - Replicate the data across multiple nodes or data centers to ensure data availability and reliability in the event of hardware failures or other issues.
   - Distribute the data across multiple nodes to balance the load and prevent any single point of failure.

2. **Exactly-Once Semantics:**
   - Implement exactly-once semantics to ensure that the data is processed exactly once, even in the event of failures or duplicates, to maintain data consistency.

3. **Checkpoints and State Management:**
   - Implement checkpoints to periodically save the state of the processing system.
   - In the event of a failure, the system can be restored to the last checkpoint and resume processing without losing data or consistency.

4. **Failure Detection and Recovery:**
   - Implement failure detection mechanisms to promptly detect any failures in the system.
   - Implement automated recovery processes to restore the system to a consistent state and resume processing after a failure.

5. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to any inconsistencies or failures promptly.

6. **Backups:**
   - Implement regular backups of the data and processing state to ensure that the system can be restored to a consistent state in case of catastrophic failures.

**Handling Late-Arriving Data in Stream Processing:**

Late-arriving data can be handled in a stream processing system with the following strategies:

1. **Windowing:**
   - Use windowing to group the data into time-based windows and process the data within each window.
   - If the late-arriving data falls within the window, it can be processed with the rest of the data in that window.

2. **Watermarking:**
   - Implement watermarks to keep track of the progress of the data processing.
   - If the late-arriving data has a timestamp earlier than the watermark, it can be processed separately or discarded, depending on the business requirements.

3. **Buffering:**
   - Implement buffering to temporarily hold the data before processing.
   - If late-arriving data comes in, it can be buffered and then processed with the rest of the data.

4. **Out-of-Order Processing:**
   - Implement mechanisms to handle out-of-order data, such as sorting or reordering the data before processing.

5. **Handling Late Data in Analytics:**
   - If the late-arriving data affects the results of real-time analytics, implement mechanisms to update the results with the late data and ensure that the results are accurate and consistent.

By implementing these strategies, a stream processing system can handle late-arriving data and ensure that the results are accurate and consistent.
