The image contains a directed graph with nodes labeled \( n_0 \) through \( n_9 \) and questions related to the graph:

(a) Give the sets \( N \), \( N_0 \), \( N_f \), and \( E \) for the graph above.
- \( N \) is the set of all nodes in the graph.
- \( N_0 \) is the set of start nodes, which have no incoming edges.
- \( N_f \) is the set of final nodes, which have no outgoing edges.
- \( E \) is the set of edges in the graph.

(b) Give a path that is not a test path in the graph above.
A path that is not a test path would be one that does not start at the start node or does not end at an end node or has loops (i.e., visits a node more than once).

(c) List all test paths in the graph above.
Test paths are paths that start at a start node, end at an end node, and do not visit any node more than once.

Let's address each question:

(a) Identifying the sets:

- \( N \) is the set of all nodes: \( \{ n_0, n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4, n_5, n_6, n_7, n_8, n_9 \} \)
- \( N_0 \), the start node, is \( \{ n_0 \} \) as it has no incoming edges.
- \( N_f \), the end nodes, are \( \{ n_7, n_8, n_9 \} \) as these nodes have no outgoing edges.
- \( E \) is the set of edges: \( \{ (n_0, n_3), (n_0, n_4), (n_0, n_5), (n_1, n_4), (n_1, n_6), (n_2, n_5), (n_2, n_6), (n_3, n_7), (n_4, n_8), (n_5, n_9), (n_6, n_9) \} \)

(b) A path that is not a test path might be \( n_4 \rightarrow n_0 \), since it does not start at a start node and does not end at an end node. Another example would be any path that starts at \( n_0 \) and loops back to \( n_0 \), such as \( n_0 \rightarrow n_4 \rightarrow n_0 \).

(c) All test paths in the graph are paths from \( n_0 \) to any of the end nodes without visiting any node more than once. Here are the test paths:
- \( n_0 \rightarrow n_3 \rightarrow n_7 \)
- \( n_0 \rightarrow n_4 \rightarrow n_8 \)
- \( n_0 \rightarrow n_5 \rightarrow n_9 \)
- \( n_1 \rightarrow n_4 \rightarrow n_8 \)
- \( n_1 \rightarrow n_6 \rightarrow n_9 \)
- \( n_2 \rightarrow n_5 \rightarrow n_9 \)
- \( n_2 \rightarrow n_6 \rightarrow n_9 \)

It's important to note that although \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \) are not start nodes and would not typically be considered for test paths starting points in a graph with a single start node, they have been included here for completeness in case the context of the problem allows considering test paths from these nodes as well.
