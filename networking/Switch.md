A switch and a router serve different purposes in a network, and the use of either depends on the specific requirements of the network architecture.

### 1. **Switch:**
   - **Purpose:** Primarily used to connect devices within the same network or subnet.
   - **Layer:** Operates at the Data Link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, although Multilayer switches can also operate at the Network layer (Layer 3).
   - **Functionality:** Switches use MAC addresses to forward frames to the appropriate port.

### 2. **Router:**
   - **Purpose:** Connects different networks or subnets and routes packets between them.
   - **Layer:** Operates at the Network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
   - **Functionality:** Routers use IP addresses to route packets to their destination network.

### Connecting Two Networks:

If you are connecting two different IP networks or subnets, a router is typically required to facilitate communication between the networks.

### Example: Connecting Two Different Networks
- **Network A:** `192.168.1.0/24`
- **Network B:** `192.168.2.0/24`

In this case, you would use a router to connect Network A to Network B, allowing devices in each network to communicate with devices in the other network.

### Use of Switch in Connecting Networks:
However, there are scenarios where you might use a switch to connect different networks, specifically by using a Layer 3 switch, which can perform routing functions in addition to switching.

### Example: Layer 3 Switch Connecting Two VLANs
- **VLAN 10:** `192.168.1.0/24`
- **VLAN 20:** `192.168.2.0/24`

In this scenario, you can use a Layer 3 switch to route traffic between VLAN 10 and VLAN 20, effectively connecting the two different networks or subnets.

### Use of Switch in Extending a Network:
If you are extending or dividing a network but still want all the devices to be in the same IP network (subnet), you would typically use a switch (or multiple switches). For example, connecting different floors of a building but having all devices on the same IP network.

### Summary:
- Use a router to connect different IP networks or subnets.
- Use a switch to connect devices within the same IP network or subnet.
- A Layer 3 switch can be used to route traffic between different networks or subnets within the same switch, combining the features of both switches and routers.
