In typical IP routing, each router makes an independent decision about where to send the packet next, based on its own routing table, and there is no predetermined end-to-end path. Here’s a simplified view of how this process works:

### 1. **Host A Sending a Packet to Host B:**
   - **IP Address:**
     - Host A determines the IP address of Host B, either because it's communicating with a known service or via DNS resolution.
   - **Subnet Check:**
     - Host A checks whether Host B is in the same subnet.
   - **ARP Request:**
     - If Host B is in the same subnet, Host A uses ARP to find Host B’s MAC address and sends the packet directly to Host B.
   - **Gateway:**
     - If Host B is not in the same subnet, Host A sends the packet to its configured gateway (usually a router).

### 2. **Router Decisions:**
   - **Routing Table Lookup:**
     - The gateway router receives the packet and looks up the destination IP address in its routing table to determine the next hop.
   - **Forwarding:**
     - The router forwards the packet to the next hop (which could be another router or the final destination, depending on the network topology).
   - **Hop by Hop:**
     - This process repeats at each subsequent router, with each router making an independent decision about the next hop, until the packet reaches its destination.

### 3. **Total Path Determination:**
   - **Dynamic Process:**
     - The total path is determined dynamically, one hop at a time, rather than being pre-determined from source to destination.
   - **Not Stored:**
     - The total path taken by a packet is generally not stored or known to any single entity in the network during transit.

### 4. **Advanced Cases:**
   - **MPLS:**
     - In some advanced networking scenarios, technologies like MPLS can establish predetermined paths (Label Switched Paths) through the network, allowing packets to follow a pre-calculated route.
   - **SDN:**
     - In Software-Defined Networking (SDN), a centralized controller can have a global view of the network and can compute and deploy end-to-end paths for flows.

### Example:
   - **Host A:** `192.168.1.2` with a default gateway of `192.168.1.1`
   - **Host B:** `10.0.0.2`
   - Host A would send the packet to its default gateway (`192.168.1.1`), and then, each router along the path would decide the next hop to forward the packet to, based on its routing table, until the packet reaches Host B (`10.0.0.2`).

### 5. **Path Discovery:**
   - **Traceroute/Tracert:**
     - Tools like `traceroute` (or `tracert` on Windows) can be used to discover the path that packets take from source to destination, displaying each hop along the way.

In summary, in traditional IP routing, there is no single entity that determines the total path from source to destination. Instead, each router on the path makes independent forwarding decisions to get the packet to the next hop, eventually reaching the destination. However, certain networking technologies like MPLS and SDN allow for more controlled and predictable path determinations.
