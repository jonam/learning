You can view the routing table of a router through its command-line interface (CLI) or through its graphical user interface (GUI) if it has one, depending on the router’s make and model. Here are the general steps you can take to view the routing table on a router. 

### For Cisco Routers (via CLI):

1. **Access the Router:**
   - Connect to the router via SSH, Telnet, or directly through a console cable.
   - You may need the appropriate credentials (username and password).

2. **Enter Privileged EXEC Mode:**
   ```
   enable
   ```

3. **View the Routing Table:**
   ```
   show ip route
   ```

   - This command will display the IP routing table, showing you directly connected networks, static routes, and routes learned through routing protocols.

### For Linux-based Routers (via Terminal):

1. **Access the Router:**
   - Access the Linux router via SSH or directly through a terminal.
   - You will need the appropriate login credentials.

2. **View the Routing Table:**
   ```
   netstat -rn
   ```
   or
   ```
   ip route
   ```

   - These commands will show you the kernel routing table, listing all the known routes on the router.

### For Routers with Web Interface:

1. **Access the Router:**
   - Open a web browser and enter the router’s IP address in the address bar.
   - Log in with the appropriate username and password.

2. **Navigate to Routing Table:**
   - Locate the section in the web interface where the routing table is displayed. This varies depending on the router’s model and firmware, but it is often found under sections labeled “Routing”, “Routes”, “Routing Table”, or similar.

### Checking on Windows:

- If you want to check the routing table on a Windows machine, you can open a Command Prompt and type:
   ```
   route print
   ```

### Checking on macOS:

- If you are on a macOS machine, you can open Terminal and type:
   ```
   netstat -rn
   ```

Remember, the specific commands and steps may vary depending on the router’s brand, model, and operating system. Always refer to the router’s documentation or online resources specific to your router’s make and model for the most accurate and detailed information.
